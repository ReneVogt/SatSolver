# SatSolver

Out of curiosity we started to implement a Satisfiability Solver.

CNFs for tests (SAT/UNSAT) taken from [here](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/benchm.html), collections uf250-1065 and uuf250-1065.


The CDCL parts are not working properly, yet... slow and buggy... work is in progress.
